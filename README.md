# EWA
Encryption Web App

  # Overview

The Cryptography Learning Web App is a web-based application designed to educate users about various encryption methods, including RSA, AES, DES, and Caesar Cipher. The app provides interactive features that simplify complex cryptography concepts, allowing users to visualize the encryption and decryption processes.

  # Features

- Interactive visualization of encryption and decryption processes.
- Step-by-step breakdown of various encryption algorithms.
- Tiered educational content for different knowledge levels (basic, intermediate, advanced).
- User-friendly interface with support for multiple browsers.

  # Tech Stack

- Backend: Python 3.12+, Flask
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Encryption Libraries: Cryptography, PyCrypto
- Visualization Libraries: D3.js, Chart.js
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- Development Environment: Windows 11
- Browser Compatibility: Google Chrome, Firefox
- Testing Frameworks: unittest (Python), Jest (JavaScript)

  # Installation

TBD
   
  # Usage (Subject to change)

- Enter a message and choose an encryption method to see the transformation from plaintext to ciphertext.
- Paste an encrypted message, select the corresponding decryption method, and view the original text.
- Experiment with the custom Unicode-based encryption to see how characters are mapped and transformed.
